 ## Introduction
Credit card fraud has become a significant concern in the financial industry, leading to substantial financial losses for both cardholders and businesses. This project addresses the issue by leveraging machine learning techniques to build a predictive model capable of identifying fraudulent credit card transactions.

The goal of this project is to provide a practical implementation of credit card fraud detection, which can be further enhanced or customized based on specific business requirements.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation is not included in this repository due to its large size. However, the project provides instructions on how to obtain and preprocess the dataset before running the model. Please refer to the Dataset directory for more details.
